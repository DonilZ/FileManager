# FileManager
Console file manager with basic features:
1) Adding/removing components (folders and files);
2) Moving up/down the directory;
3) Displaying various information about the directory.
4) Displaying of all errors and changes in file manager

New features will gradually be added.
The code is covered by tests at ~60% (for calculated I used tool for .NET Core "Minicover").
